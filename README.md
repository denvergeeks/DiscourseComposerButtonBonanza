# Composer Button Bonanza for Discourse

###  *"Composer Affordances that You Can Afford!"*

**Composer Button Bonanza** is a [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)
theme component which provides more markup buttons for the Composer UI
(the interface for composing posts and messages).

Out-of-the-box, it provides a slew of new buttons, a mess of buttons,
a _bonanza_ of buttons.  Via the configuration settings, you can:
 * add and/or remove button definitions;
 * select which buttons to show, and when to show them;
 * change the ordering of buttons, and decide whether buttons should be rendered in the toolbar directly, or the toolbar's ⚙️ pop-up menu;
 * provide translations/localizations for the buttons.

This component does not *define* any new markup or styling --- it merely adds
convenient buttons ("affordances") to type out existing markup that will invoke
existing styles.  Its primary purpose is to help your users to discover
that the markup exists.  E.g., users who use a lot of footnotes will
probably just bang the `^[` and `]` directly on the keyboard; but the rest
of us will be happy to have an ✳️ button to remind us what to do.

A benefit of this approach is that if you decide the remove this theme
component, you will not disturb the styling of any existing posts.  This
component is not responsible for doing any styling; it just provides
shortcuts to functionality already in the Composer, and/or provided by other
plugins or theme components.
